# OPS-201d10-OPS-Challenges
## This Repo is dedicated to all the OPS Challenges that Code Fellows Cybersecurity 201, Foundations of Computer Operations,  has their students work on throughout the class.  The primary focus is to develop a solid foundation in shell scripting for PowerShell and Bash so that as students are well prepared as they get read for the next four week course focusing on networking.
### My favorite OPS Challenge to date was working on Loops and Conditionals OPS Challenge. This was the first time I had done any real coding and working through and troubleshooting the issues was very fun. 
### One of the best parts of the OPS Challenges so far has been seeing how other people script the challenge and how it differs from what I scripted.
### I think the biggest skillset I need to improve is the more complex PowerShell scripts that automate establishing all of the system settings the way I want when I do not have premade image.
